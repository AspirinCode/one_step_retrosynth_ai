## Single-step Retrosynthesis Prediction based on the Identification of Potential Disconnection Sites using Molecular Substructure Fingerprints
A novel, template-free approach for the one-step retrosynthesis task described in a journal paper which is 
currently under review. Depending on the journal decision, the link will be posted here.

### Running the Code
This repository is still raw and under construction, but the authors are actively working on it. 
For now, the individual functions need to be executed manually according to the short description in the ```main.py``` file. 
In time, appropriate scripts will be written and the user manual will be posted. 

#### Installation
Install [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/), create and activate your environment by running:

```shell script
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
```shell script
conda activate osra_env
```

#### Configuration
The general configuration of each step is stored in the ```config.json``` file. It specifies all of the necessary dataset, descriptor and model configurations.

#### 1. Dataset Preparation
The dataset can be generated by running the following command:

```shell script
python -m scripts.prepare_dataset config.json
```
The process consists out of 5 steps and the final dataset is saved in the folder specified in the configuration. 

#### 2. Model Training
The specified model can be trained and assessed by running the following command:

```shell script
python -m scripts.train_model config.json
```
All of the hyper-parameters are specified in the configuration. 

#### 3. Full Pipeline Application
TBD.

### Requirements
The following main libraries were used for the realization of the project:

* python: 3.6.8
* rdkit: 2018.09.1.0
* tensorflow: 1.12.0

Additional libraries that were used include:

* cairosvg: 2.2.1
